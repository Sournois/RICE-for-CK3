Though it had been in decline for years, the collapse of the Kalbid Emirate in 1040 CE heralded the start of a new era of civil war and fragmentation in Muslim Sicily. Unlike Iberia, where some local #italic taifas#! were able to become reasonably powerful, prosperous regional centers, the #italic taifas#! of Sicily were relative weak and unable to consolidate their power, and had to seek the aid of foreign powers against their rivals. For instance, the Zirid dynasty of North Africa continuously intervened in the island's politics for decades.\n\nWith that context, the fact that Ibn al-Thumna, the ruler of Syracuse, requested for Norman military aid in 1061 CE is not so abnormal. Nonetheless, al-Thumna's death in 1062 provided the Normans under Roger a convenient excuse to conquer the whole island. Interestingly, al-Thumna's followers continued fighting alongside Roger as allies, and some local Christians were among those who resisted the Normans.\n\nA later ruler of Syracuse, Ibn Abbad, known in Christian sources as Benavert, led the last resistance to the Normans. After his death in 1086 in battle, the Norman conquest of Sicily concluded with the fall of Noto in 1091."

 sicily.0151.t:0 "Arrival"
 sicily.0151.desc:0 "I have finally arrived at the commune of Monte Sant'Angelo on the southern slopes of Monte Gargano, not too far from [GetTitleByKey('b_vieste').GetNameNoTooltip]. Already, in what would otherwise be a humble town, I am surrounded by all sorts of travelers and [christian.GetAdjective] pilgrims.\n\nFor now, we must find lodgings and rest first. Soon, however, we will make our way to the sanctuary of Saint Michael, the gateway to the famous cave that is the centerpiece of the pilgrimage here."
 sicily.0151.a:0 "Time to rest for the evening."
 sicily.0152.t:0 "Into the Cave"
 sicily.0152.desc:0 "They say many years ago, a farmer lost one of his bulls. After searching for hours, he found it by a cave. Yet, no matter what he did, even when he shot an arrow at it, it did not move.\n\nThe farmer found this odd, and asked the local bishop for help. The bishop went inside, and saw an apparition of Saint Michael, alongside an altar. This is how Gargano became a major pilgrimage site.\n\nToday, I’ve made my way up Monte Gargano to this same sanctuary."
 sicily.0152.a:0 "Time to go in the cavern to pray to Saint Michael."
 sicily.0153.t:0 "The Cave"
 sicily.0153.desc:0 "The cavern is a magnificent place. It is not the magnificence of towering cathedrals or fortresses; it is not the magnificence of a never-ending metropolis. Nay, this is the quiet, subtle magnificence of a place touched by the heavens, and Saint Michael in particular, a place permeating with divine energy.\n\nThere stands the altar, by which the bishop discovered the apparition of Saint Michael long ago. There, below my feet, is the floor which is wet from the waters of the holy spring nearby, which some pilgrims desperately lick to gain blessings. And there, fervently praying for the Archangel’s blessings by the altar, are the other pilgrims.\n\nI make my way to the altar, kneel, and begin praying myself."

 sicily.0154.t:0 "Leaving the Cave"
 sicily.0154.desc:0 "After leaving some votive offerings at the altar, I emerge from the cave back into the sanctuary of Saint Michael. I feel and look like a new [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] – or, at least, that’s what my companions tell me.\n\nWhile the cult of Saint Michael is strong throughout the world, there is nowhere where it is stronger than here, in Monte Gargano, or at least it would seem so after visiting it.\n\nI’m blessed to have been able to make this trip here, and I will surely not forget it."
 sicily.0154.a:0 "We’ll rest here for a bit, then make our way home."
